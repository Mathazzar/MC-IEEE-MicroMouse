# MC IEEE MicroMouse Team

Welcome!

This is where we will work on our code for the IEEE SAC MicroMouse competition in April of 2020. Until we decide otherwise, I am setting this repo as public. 

This is the repo from last year: https://github.com/R3rout3d/MicroMouseIEEEPublic

Here are some repos made by our predecesors we might find useful:
