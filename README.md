# MC IEEE MicroMouse Team

Welcome!

This is where we will work on our code for the IEEE SAC MicroMouse competition in April of 2020 (now for the 2021 competition). This repo is public for now. Once everyone has acess who needs to, we can make it private. The plan is to use Dijkstra's algorithm. We'll also need to develop an easy interface with the ardunio (nice move functions, etc.)

**Please do not push to the master branch until all files you intend to push are tested and working. Please create a branch or fork and work on files there until FULLY completed.**
