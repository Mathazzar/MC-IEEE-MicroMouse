# MC IEEE MicroMouse Team

Welcome!

This is where we will work on our code for the IEEE SAC MicroMouse competition in April of 2020. This repo is public.
We're planning to use Dijkstra's algorithm. We'll also need to develop an easy interface with the ardunio (nice move functions, etc.)

This is the repo from last year: https://github.com/R3rout3d/MicroMouseIEEEPublic

Here are some previous repos from our MC team:
