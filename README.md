# MC IEEE MicroMouse Team

Welcome!

This is where we will work on our code for the IEEE SAC MicroMouse competition in April of 2020. This repo is public for now. Once everyone has acess who needs to, we can make it private. The plan is to use Dijkstra's algorithm. We'll also need to develop an easy interface with the ardunio (nice move functions, etc.)
